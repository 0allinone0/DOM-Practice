# Practicing Event Driven Program

This is a starter file that you can use to practice:
- Selecting item from the DOM using `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`
- Modifying elements once they have been selected
- Listening to events on the DOM with `.addEventListener()`
- Practicing using HTML data-* attributes and using this information in your code.
